In Angular there are 2 types of Form
1. Template driven
2. Reactive driven

1. Template driven
* it is an static form 
* we write the code in html and connect it with ts with some directives
* by default whenever we have a form in html angular creates an JS Object for us. But its values are empty by default
* we need to add the properties to its.
* inputs are not registed in the object by defaults we need to tell the angular about the inputs
* we add "name" attribute of html and add "ngModel" directive of angular to tell that the inputs belong to the forms


2. Reactive form
* we create form in ts and angular add the form in DOM
