In Angular there are 2 types of Form
1. Template driven
2. Reactive driven

1. Template driven
* it is an static form 
* we write the code in html and connect it with ts with some directives
* by default whenever we have a form in html angular creates an JS Object for us. But its values are empty by default
* we need to add the properties to its.
* inputs are not registed in the object by defaults we need to tell the angular about the inputs

2. Reactive form
* we create form in ts and angular add the form in DOM


Template Driven Forms in Angular
* we add "name" attribute of html and add "ngModel" directive of angular to tell that the inputs belong to the forms
* By default of submiting form html form try to send the data which is default. Angular uses this and added 
    ngSubmit event listenser on form element in that method we can pass the form element reference to it which will contains the form data.
